00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.807
Formations, like these,

2
00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:06.599
require long hours of intensive drilling
and careful judgment.

3
00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:09.095
When the troop goes around the corner,

4
00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.743
the riders on the outside of the turn
have to adjust their speed

5
00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:15.061
to keep even with the riders on the inside.

6
00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:20.139
The man on the outside
has to ride a lot further and a lot faster

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.085
in order to keep up with the parade.

8
00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:28.196
The outside wheels must spin faster
than the wheels on the inside

9
00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:32.666
because they have a greater distance to travel
in the same length of time.

10
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:38.052
When a wagon turns a corner,
the wheels can travel at different speeds

11
00:00:38.053 --> 00:00:41.808
because each one can turn freely on the axles.

12
00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.821
And in the early automobiles,
the rear wheels turned separately

13
00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:48.820
and only one wheel
was connected to the engine.

14
00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:52.631
But when only one wheel
was driven by the engine,

15
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:54.662
it had to do all the work,

16
00:00:54.703 --> 00:00:59.206
and it couldn't get a good enough grip
on the road to do its job properly.

17
00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.308
So the one-wheel drive
was soon out of date.

18
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:09.101
But if two wheels are locked on an axle,
so that they are not free to turn separately,

19
00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:11.869
one or the other has to slide.

20
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:15.851
So engineers had to find a way
to connect both rear wheels

21
00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:19.580
to the engine,
without sliding and slipping on turns.

22
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.113
The device which makes this possible
is a part of the rear axle.

23
00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.892
It is called the differential,

24
00:01:27.893 --> 00:01:32.209
because it can drive the rear wheels
at different speeds.

25
00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:34.804
The differential looks complicated.

26
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.215
But once we understand its principle,
it is amazingly simple.

27
00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:42.763
These two wheels are mounted
on separate axles

28
00:01:42.764 --> 00:01:44.593
and supported by a frame,

29
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:49.798
so that they can revolve freely
at different speeds.

30
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.415
Let's fasten a spoke
on the inner end of each axle.

31
00:01:56.754 --> 00:02:02.461
So that by turning the spokes,
we can turn each wheel separately.

32
00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:11.614
With a bar or cross piece,
we can turn both wheels

33
00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:15.973
in the same direction
at the same rate of speed.

34
00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.418
Let's get something
to hold this bar in place,

35
00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.509
so that it will press against the spokes.

36
00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:26.468
Notice that this support
is not locked to the axle,

37
00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.842
it turns freely.

38
00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:33.129
Now, we can spin the wheels
by rotating the support.

39
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:39.111
This is fine, as long as both wheels
are able to turn at the same speed.

40
00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:43.264
But let's see what happens
when we go around the corner.

41
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.927
With this arrangement, we cannot drive
one wheel faster than the other.

42
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.802
And if we stop one wheel,
the other wheel won't budge.

43
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.533
Let put this bar on a pivot,
so that it can swing in either direction.

44
00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:18.996
Now, the bar can still turn both wheels
at the same speed.

45
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:24.697
And, because it pivots,
it lets one wheel turn

46
00:03:24.698 --> 00:03:27.523
even when the other is stopped.

47
00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:33.075
But, if turned too far,
the bar will swing around

48
00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:37.004
until it won't drive the spokes
that turn either wheel.

49
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.766
We need another crossbar
and more spokes to carry on the job.

50
00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:45.434
When we stop one wheel,

51
00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.121
the crossbars will continue to push
the spokes of the free wheel around.

52
00:03:52.683 --> 00:03:55.245
As long as both wheels
are free to turn,

53
00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:02.744
the bars do not swing on their pivots
and the wheels move at the same speed.

54
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.034
Now we have the working principles
of a differential.

55
00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:14.012
To adapt the model for use in an automobile,
we will have to make a few changes.

56
00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:20.981
In order to reduce the jerky action,
caused by wide spaces between the spokes,

57
00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:24.276
we will put in more spokes.

58
00:04:28.022 --> 00:04:33.844
Further filling in the spaces between the spokes
gives steadier, more continuous action.

59
00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:39.002
And changing the shape
gives firm, constant contact.

60
00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:43.012
Now we can make the gears
thicker and stronger,

61
00:04:43.144 --> 00:04:46.348
and we have differential gears.

62
00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:51.881
The edges are cut so that they will fit together
more smoothly and silently.

63
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:56.659
And another gear is added
to share the work of driving the axles.

64
00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.234
The principle is the same.

65
00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.949
In order to turn the support
and drive the wheels,

66
00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:09.229
we can fasten a large gear here,
connected by a smaller gear

67
00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:11.663
to a source of power.

68
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.565
Notice that the power
is connected to the differential

69
00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:23.263
at the center line.

70
00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:30.535
We can make our model more compact
by moving the gears closer together.

71
00:05:31.868 --> 00:05:34.316
When we put our differential
in an automobile,

72
00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:36.899
we have to leave room
for the drive shaft,

73
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.978
which carries the power from the engine.

74
00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:43.875
We may build the floor of the car
above the drive shaft.

75
00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:49.151
But, if we do,
we won't have much room inside,

76
00:05:49.152 --> 00:05:51.839
unless we make the top of the car high too.

77
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.105
Of course,
we could lower the floor and ceiling,

78
00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:58.129
but the drive shaft
would be higher than the floor.

79
00:05:58.703 --> 00:06:00.440
This would have disadvantages.

80
00:06:01.536 --> 00:06:04.315
A shaft in the middle of the floor
of an automobile

81
00:06:04.316 --> 00:06:09.535
would be inconvenient for passengers,
and would be awkward for carrying luggage.

82
00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:15.118
Today, engineers have found a way
to make the car roomier and closer to the road

83
00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:18.396
without a clumsy shaft above the floor.

84
00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:24.542
The drive shaft from the engine to the differential
is lowered out of the way.

85
00:06:25.226 --> 00:06:29.386
And the drive shaft is connected
to the rear axle at the bottom.

86
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.199
The new low center drive makes the rear axle
quieter, stronger, and more durable

87
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:41.334
because it gives better, smoother contact
between the gears.

88
00:06:42.343 --> 00:06:45.789
The automobile of today
with the low center drive

89
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.989
is stronger and more rugged.

90
00:06:49.592 --> 00:06:54.356
Every part of the rear axle
has been build to withstand strains,

91
00:06:54.357 --> 00:06:57.591
far greater than it will ever meet
on the straight way

92
00:06:57.592 --> 00:06:59.455
or around the corner.

93
00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:18.578
Inside Wheel

94
00:07:19.077 --> 00:07:20.579
Outside Wheel

95
00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:23.408
Inside Wheel

96
00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:25.969
Outside Wheel

97
00:07:26.504 --> 00:07:28.572
Inside Wheel

98
00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:30.365
Outside Wheel

99
01:10:28.967 --> 01:15:30.365
