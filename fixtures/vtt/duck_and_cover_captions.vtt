00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:10.280
♫ There was a turtle by the name of Bert

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.467
♫ and Bert the turtle was very alert.

4
00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:16.631
♫ When danger threatened him he never got hurt,

5
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:19.713
♫ he knew just what to do:

6
00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:23.161
♫ He'd duck and cover!

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.977
♫ Duck and cover!

8
00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:29.413
♫ He did what we all must learn to do

9
00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:32.618
♫ You, and you, and you, and you

10
00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:36.101
♫ Duck and cover!

[song ends]

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.785
Announcer: Be sure and remember what Bert the turtle does, dear friends,

13
00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:43.810
because everyone of us must remember to do the same thing.

14
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.050
That's what this film is all about.

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.744
Duck and cover!

16
00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:51.182
This is an official civil defense film produced in

17
00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.729
cooperation with the with the Federal Civil Defense Administration and in

18
00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.659
consultation with the Safety Commission of the National Education Association.

19
00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.863
Produced by Archer Productions, Inc.

20
00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:06.031
Hey, Bert, come on out and meet all these nice people!

21
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.072
Please? Oh, alright, we really can't blame you.

22
00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:13.450
You see, Bert is a very, very careful fellow.

23
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.072
When there's danger, this is the way he keeps from being hurt.

24
00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:20.555
Sometimes, it even saves his life.

25
00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:24.810
That's why these children are practicing to duck and cover,

26
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.662
just as you do in your school.

27
00:01:26.662 --> 00:01:30.424
We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous.

28
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.895
Since it may be used against us, we must get ready for it,

29
00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:37.901
just as we are ready for many other dangers that are around us all the time.

30
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:39.898
Fire is a danger.

31
00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:43.415
It can burn whole buildings if someone is careless.

32
00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:45.552
But we are ready for fires.

33
00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:49.557
We have a fine fire department to put out the fire and

34
00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:52.657
you have fire drills in your school so you know what to do.

35
00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:57.823
Automobiles can be dangerous too; they sometimes cause bad accidents.

36
00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:01.742
But we are ready. We have safety rules that car drivers and people who

37
00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:03.083
are walking must obey.

38
00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:06.688
Now, we must be ready for a new danger:

39
00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:08.145
the atomic bomb.

40
00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:12.823
First, you have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explodes.

41
00:02:12.823 --> 00:02:17.317
You'll know when it comes—we hope it never comes, but we must get ready.

42
00:02:17.317 --> 00:02:18.977
It looks something like this:

43
00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:23.284
There's a bright flash, brighter than the Sun, brighter than anything you've ever seen!

44
00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:27.069
If you're not ready and did not know what to do,

45
00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.704
it could hurt you in different ways.

46
00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:34.453
It could knock you down hard or throw you against a tree or a wall.

47
00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:39.155
It is such a big explosion, it can smash in buildings and knock signboards over

48
00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:41.674
and break windows all over town!

49
00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:46.492
But if you duck and cover—like Bert—you'll be much safer.

50
00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:49.697
You know how bad sunburn can feel.

51
00:02:49.697 --> 00:02:54.016
The atomic bomb flash could burn you worse than a terrible sunburn,

52
00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:56.152
especially where you're not covered.

53
00:02:56.152 --> 00:03:00.250
Now, you and I don't have shells to crawl into like Bert the turtle,

54
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.677
so we have to cover up in our own way.

55
00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:06.752
First, you duck, and then, you cover.

56
00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:10.618
And very tightly, you cover the back of your neck and your face.

57
00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:16.028
Duck and cover underneath a table or desk or anything else close by.

58
00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:20.312
In Betty's school, they are talking about the atomic bomb too.

59
00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:25.699
Betty is asking her teacher: How can we tell when the atomic bomb may explode?

60
00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.217
And her teacher is explaining that there are two kinds of attack:

61
00:03:29.217 --> 00:03:32.096
with warning and without any warning.

62
00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:36.793
We think that most of the time we will be warned before the bomb explodes.

63
00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:41.976
So there will be time for us to get into our homes, schools, or some other safe place.

64
00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:47.305
Our Civil Defense workers and our men in uniform will do everything they can

65
00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:51.032
to warn us before enemy planes can bring a bomb near us.

66
00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:55.641
You may be in your schoolyard playing when the signal comes.

67
00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:58.600
[sound of civil defense sirens]

68
00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:04.314
That signal means to stop whatever you are doing and get to the nearest safe place fast.

69
00:04:04.314 --> 00:04:11.073
Always remember: The flash of an atomic bomb can come at any time, no matter where you may be!

70
00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:15.077
You might be out playing at home when the warning comes.

71
00:04:15.077 --> 00:04:23.343
Then be sure to get into the house fast, where your parents have fixed a safe place for you to go.

72
00:04:23.343 --> 00:04:28.927
If you are not close to home when you hear the warning, go to the nearest safe cover.

73
00:04:28.927 --> 00:04:33.745
Know where you are to go or ask an older person to help you.

74
00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:39.945
You know the places marked with the "S" sign? They're safe places to go when you hear the alarm.

75
00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:44.728
If there is a warning, you will hear it before the bomb explodes.

76
00:04:44.728 --> 00:04:53.297
But sometimes—and this is very, very important—sometimes the bomb might explode without any warning!

77
00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:57.337
Then the first thing we would know about it would be the flash

78
00:04:57.337 --> 00:05:02.631
and that means duck and cover fast, wherever you are! There's no time to look around or wait.

79
00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:07.832
Be like Bert! When there is a flash, duck and cover, and do it fast!

80
00:05:07.832 --> 00:05:13.359
Here are some older boys showing what to do if the flash comes when you are not in the classroom.

81
00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:20.684
This is what to do if you should be in a corridor: You duck and cover tight against the wall this way.

82
00:05:20.684 --> 00:05:24.969
Remember to keep your face and the back of your neck covered tightly.

83
00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.055
Try to fall away from windows or doors with glass in them.

84
00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:32.910
Then, if the glass breaks and flies through the air, it won't cut you.

85
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.381
You might be eating your lunch when the flash comes.

86
00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:38.784
Duck and cover under the table!

87
00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:43.812
Then, if the explosion makes anything in the room fall down, it can't fall on you.

88
00:05:43.812 --> 00:05:49.245
Getting ready means we will all have to be able to take care of ourselves.

89
00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:54.737
The bomb might explode when there are no grown-ups near. Paul and Patty know this.

90
00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:57.558
And they are always ready to take care of themselves.

91
00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:02.329
Here they are on their way to school on a beautiful spring day, but no matter where

92
00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:08.912
they go or what they do, they always try to remember what to do if the atom bomb explodes right then.

93
00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:11.525
It's a bomb! Duck and cover!

94
00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:17.527
Paul and Patty know what to do. Paul covered the back of his head, so that he wouldn't be burned.

95
00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:20.650
And Patty covered herself with the coat she was carrying.

96
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.851
They knew how to duck and cover. They acted right away when the flash came.

97
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:33.189
If they had been at this doorway when the bomb flashed, Paul and Patty would have ducked and covered this way, like this girl.

98
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:36.498
Heavy doorways are a good place to duck and cover.

99
00:06:36.498 --> 00:06:38.506
She will be safer too.

100
00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:42.128
Here's Tony going to his Cub Scout meeting.

101
00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:47.225
Tony knows the bomb can explode any time of the year, day or night. He is ready for it.

102
00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:49.118
Duck and cover!

103
00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:53.483
Attaboy, Tony, that flash means: act fast!

104
00:06:53.483 --> 00:06:56.595
Tony knows that it helps to get to any kind of cover.

105
00:06:56.595 --> 00:07:00.658
This wall was close by, so that's where he ducked and covered.

106
00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:05.430
Tony knew what to do. Notice how he keeps from moving, or from getting up and running?

107
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.331
He stays down until he is sure the danger is over.

108
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:13.104
The man helping Tony is a Civil Defense worker.

109
00:07:13.104 --> 00:07:17.748
His job is to help protect us when there is danger of the atomic bomb.

110
00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:20.685
We must obey the Civil Defense worker!

111
00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:27.349
We must know how to duck and cover in the school bus, or in any other bus or street car.

112
00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:33.143
Duck and cover! Don't wait, duck away from the windows fast!

113
00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:36.428
The glass may break and fly through the air and cut you.

114
00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:43.336
Sundays, holidays, vacation time—we must be ready every day, all the time,

115
00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:46.970
to do the right thing if the atomic bomb explodes.

116
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.037
Duck and cover!

117
00:07:49.037 --> 00:07:53.309
This family knows what to do, just as your own family should.

118
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:59.544
They know that even a thin cloth helps protect them. Even a newspaper can save you from a bad burn.

119
00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:06.103
But the most important thing of all is to duck and cover yourself, especially where your clothes do not cover you.

120
00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:13.511
No matter where we live, in the city or the country, we must be ready all the time for the atomic bomb.

121
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:15.647
Duck and cover!

122
00:08:15.647 --> 00:08:24.552
That's the first thing to do, duck and cover. The next important thing to do after that is to stay covered until the danger is over.

123
00:08:24.552 --> 00:08:32.609
Yes, we must all get ready now, so we know how to save ourselves if the atomic bomb ever explodes near us.

124
00:08:32.609 --> 00:08:37.915
If you not know just what to do, ask your teacher when this film is over.

125
00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:42.025
Discuss what you could do in different places if a bomb explodes.

126
00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:48.445
Older people will help us as they always do, but there might not be any grown-ups around when the bomb explodes.

127
00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.930
Then, you're on your own.

128
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.112
Bert the turtle: Remember what to do, friends!

129
00:08:53.112 --> 00:08:57.222
Now tell me right out loud, what are you supposed to do when you see the flash?

130
00:08:57.222 --> 00:09:00.752
Children: Duck and cover!

131
00:09:00.752 --> 00:09:04.595
