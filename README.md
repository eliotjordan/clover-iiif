# Clover IIIF

**Extensible IIIF front-end toolkit and Manifest viewer. Accessible. Composable. Open Source.**

Clover IIIF is a suite of Manifest and Collection components combined with lower-level IIIF Presentation 3.0 API UI components. Designed with a focus on accessibility, customization, and developer experience. You can use Clover IIIF to build your own custom IIIF-fluent web interfaces while still using the full power of the IIIF Presentation 3.0 API.

### Development

Clover IIIF front-end development occurs within Next.js based [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) documentation. The default url for the local server is `http://localhost:3000`, unless the `3000` port is in use.

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Testing

Clover IIIF utilizes [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.

```shell
# Run tests
npm run test
```

```shell
# Run coverage report on the tests
npm run coverage
```

The coverage report uses [Vitest UI](https://vitest.dev/guide/ui.html). It will output a coverage report in the terminal, and open a nicer looking HTML coverage report as well.
